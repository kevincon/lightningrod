        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Dropbox is great...when you have access to their desktop client. But you can't use the desktop client on public computers in labs, libraries, and internet cafes because you're not given admin privileges to install software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dropbox does have a terrific website that lets you download individual files (or multiple files as a zip archive), but your changes aren't synced until you re-upload the file to the website. Also, Dropbox's website doesn't let you upload entire folders, so it can be a real hassle to work with Dropbox files on a public computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're building a Dropbox client from scratch that can run from a flash drive. We call it "Lightning Rod."

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><b>What is Lightning Rod?</b></p>
            <p>Lightning Rod is a Dropbox client for flash drives.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p><b>Wait, doesn't Dropbox already have a client?</b></p>
                <p>If you are using a computer that has restrictions on installing programs,(like in a computer lab, library, or internet cafe), you won't be allowed to install Dropbox's desktop client.</p>
          <p>That's where Lightning Rod comes in. Lightning Rod allows you to change/upload/download your Dropbox files on your flash drive, and any changes you make will be synced automatically.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p><b>Will this work on all computers I take my flash drive with Lightning Rod to?</b></p>
                <p>Yes! Lightning Rod was designed to use Java, which most computers have (Macs even come with it already installed). If you do not have the latest version of Java, you can get it <a href="http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">here</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p><b>Is there any registration required?</b></p>
                <p>All you need is a Dropbox account.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p><b>How is LightningRod different from DropboxPortableAHK?</b><p>
          <p>We believe Lightning Rod is the first cross-platform portable Dropbox client, using Java and your web browser to access files.</p>
          <p>It requires no previous installation of the Dropbox client on a portable drive.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p><b>Wait! I'm experiencing *insert problem here*!</b></p>
          <p>Send an email with the description of your problem to support@getlightningrod.com and we will address your issue as soon as we can!</p>

          <p>Maybe! Send us an email at contact@getlightningrod.com.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p><b>How did you find the time to make this?</b><p>
          <p>Lightning Rod was created in a matter of 30 hours at the Angelhack hackathon in Boston, MA in March 2012.</p>
